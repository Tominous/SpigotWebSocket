With this Plugin can you control you Server from every Computer in the WorldWideWeb. To use it, just put it into you 'plugins'-folder and reload the server. Then is a Config generated, and you can edit it. Here is a example-config below:
Config:
```
Code (YAML):
port: 25566
language: de
users:
  Rasmus: aGFsbG8= [This is encrypted via '/crypter hallo']
writes:
- Rasmus
```
Then you can start the Client over you Terminal. Open it, and type 'java -jar /apth/to/jar.jar <language>' or 'java -jar /apth/to/jar.jar <server> <port>' or 'java -jar /apth/to/jar.jar <server> <port> <language>' . Then follow the Instructions. Available languages are 'de' or 'en'. You can only type Comands, when you are on the "writes"-List.

Have fun!
